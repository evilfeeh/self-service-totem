This Project about Tech Challenge from FIAP
A monolith backend Developed with TypeScript, Docker, DDD and hexagonal architecture.

## ABOUT

We're introducing an Software that aims to optimize the self-service process in fast-food restaurants. Through an interactive totem, customers can place their orders quickly, conveniently and autonomously, reducing queues and speeding up service.

Our **Event Storming** can be found here: https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVKVP2yDY=/

## PREREQUISITES

  <img alt="Docker" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Docker-latest">

## HOW TO SETUP:

Clone the project repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/evilfeeh/self-service-totem.git
```

Access the project directory:

```bash
cd self-service-totem
```

Run the application with Docker Compose:

```bash
docker compose up
```

The apps runs into port 3000, it's possible to change the value port or other environments inside a .env file

To access the docs, access:
`http://localhost:3000/public/docs`

## HOW TO SETUP KUBERNETES:

In your local environment, you'll need to use `Minikube` and `Kubectl` to implement our application locally.

to see how it works, please follow these:

-   [links to MiniKube Documentation](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start)
-   [links to Kubectl Documentation](https://kubernetes.io/pt-br/docs/reference/kubectl/)

After following this steps, you'll need run the namespace creation in the terminal:

```bash
    cd k8s/
    kubectl apply -f namespace.yaml
```

After this, run the following commands to run the api and the database:

```bash
    kubectl apply -f api/
    kubectl apply -f mysql/
```

This commands will create:

-   API deployment - containg our solution
-   Database statefulset
-   Load Balancer Service for API and a ClusterIP none for database
-   ConfigMap with with environment variables
-   Secrets with database credentials
-   HPA to scale the pods automatically
-   PV, PVC and StorageClass to create disk for the application

## Accessing the API

After running everything, you can use the `Kubectl` commands to ensure the pods are initialized. To access the Swagger aplication, you'll need to port fowarding the api.

Specify the API's pod name and run:

```bash
kubectl port-forward <api-pod-name> 3000:3000
```

## Performance test:

To see the pods scaling, we create a k6 perfomance test that can be found on `./k6-escalabity-tests.js`

**Don't forget to install [K6](https://k6.io/docs/get-started/installation/) before execute this**

Run it and get the pods to se how its scale:

```bash
k6 run k6-escalabity-tests.js
```
